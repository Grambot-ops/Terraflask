commands:
before docker compose up -d
do this:
docker-compose build application # Make sure the image is up-to-date

docker-compose run --rm \
 -u root \
 -v "$(pwd)/example-flask-crud:/app" \
 --entrypoint "" \
 application flask db init

    docker-compose run --rm: Starts a new, temporary container based on the application service definition and removes it (--rm) when done.

    -v "$(pwd)/example-flask-crud:/app": This is key. It mounts your local example-flask-crud directory into the /app directory inside the temporary container. When flask db init creates the migrations folder inside /app, it will actually appear in your local example-flask-crud directory because of this volume mount. $(pwd) ensures it uses the correct absolute path to your current directory.

    --entrypoint "": This prevents the container from running the default /entrypoint.sh script. We only want to run our specific command.

    application: Specifies which service definition from docker-compose.yaml to use.

    flask db init: The actual command to execute inside the container. FLASK_APP is automatically picked up from the .env file defined in the service.

# Make sure DB is running first (docker-compose up -d db; sleep 15)

docker-compose run --rm \
 -u root \
 -v "$(pwd)/example-flask-crud:/app" \
 --entrypoint "" \
 application flask db migrate -m "Initial migration"

    This uses the same logic as the init command (temporary container, volume mount, blank entrypoint).

    It automatically connects to the db service over the app-network defined in your docker-compose.yaml.

    -m "Initial migration" adds a descriptive message to the migration file.

After both init and migrate commands have run successfully, execute this on your host machine (R2D2Jr):

# Make sure you are still in the Docker directory:

# ~/Documents/Docker/Cloud Platform/DeployToAws2/Docker

sudo chown -R $(id -u):$(id -g) example-flask-crud/migrations

IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_START
Use code with caution. Bash
IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_END

    sudo: Required because the files are owned by root.

    chown -R: Changes ownership recursively.

    $(id -u): Gets your current user's UID (e.g., 1000 for grambot).

    $(id -g): Gets your current user's primary GID (e.g., 1000 for grambot).

    example-flask-crud/migrations: The target directory.

The Correct Workflow (Recap):

    Manual One-Time Setup (as we just did):

        Run docker-compose run --rm -u root ... flask db init

        Run docker-compose run --rm -u root ... flask db migrate -m "Initial migration"

        Fix ownership: sudo chown -R $(id -u):$(id -g) example-flask-crud/migrations

        Commit example-flask-crud/migrations to Git.

    Build the Image:

        docker-compose build application (or just docker-compose build)

        This copies your code, including the now-existing migrations directory, into the image.

    Run the Application:

        docker-compose up -d

        The entrypoint.sh inside the container runs flask db upgrade. It finds the migration scripts inside /app/migrations (copied during the build) and applies them to the database (db service). The application then starts.
